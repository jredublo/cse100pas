PATHFINDER ALGORITHM: 


. make the graph from input file (argv[1]) (same as in printGraph)
. get the pairs that we need to check from 2nd input file (argv[3])
. iterate through the whole map and add to the unvisitedQueue  using BFS ??????? 
. find(first actor call him kevin) in theMap using an iterator and decoy
. iterate thru kevins connections (adjacent edges)
    . add 1 to the currDist of them and thencheck if
    currDist is less than the dist already stored. if 
    so, dist stored = currDist and addd kevin to their pred members
. pop 


    open an ofstream
    load in the output file (argv[4])
    write to ofstream
    close the ofstream
